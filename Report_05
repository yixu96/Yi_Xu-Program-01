For the program 05, we are asked to set a virtual world by python.
We set up a RPG game, which we have a hero, a monster and many other items like food, armor, task_item, etc.
During the program, the hero can go upstairs and downstairs, also, he can become much stronger by picking up the treasure.
Also, we set up some shortcut key for each action, like move to the left with "h" and remove armor with "A".

I have the following methods beside the __init__ method.
Look_at(), move_to(position), inventory() and drop(index), etc.
For the drop(index), it makes the player drop the item with the corresponding index on the inventor list.
This method returns a string indicating whether the operation was successful.

I have one question:
def pickup(self, treasure):
  if treasure != "gold":
    self.inventory.append(treasure)
  else:
    self.gold += 1

I can't understand why I can't use the append here. I'm very confused about that.
I look for the function online, but the example they provided are successful used the append.
