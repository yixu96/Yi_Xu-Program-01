The most of solution techniques I used in this program are functions.
I use simpleExpressionIsValid, evaluateSimpleExpression during the whole program.
Also, I use for loop and if/elif/else function.

Important variables:
1.lis = stringin.split(i) Use string to translate and split.
2.result = eval('%d%s%d'%(float(digit[0]), i, float(digit[1])))
%s is used as a placeholder for string values you want inject into a formatted string.
%d is used as a placeholder for numeric or decimal values.
