I used "for" loop and "while" loop during my program.
"For" loop has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.
"While" loop repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

Algorithm in this project.
Make sure what is my input first;
Then, calculating run formulas and check if they are correct;
At last, print what we want.

For the question in report 1 and 2:
The programs are still work if the user doesn't enter more than a single character.
In report 2, I found it was sill symmetric when I enter 2 characters and it didn't affect others.
And I certify this two problems in Project 3.

Also, I am confused for project 5. It looks like a ellipse instead of a circle.
I checked my formulas and I can't find my mistakes. Maybe this are the limits.
