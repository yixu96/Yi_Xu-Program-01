For this program, I try to detect fraud in a dataset by examining the last digits of number s in the dataset.
We are asked to read and clean Iranian election data, make a histogram, plot election data, smaller samples have more variation
comparing variation of samples, comparing variation of samples and interpret my result.

def ones_and_tens_digit_histogram(numbers)
I define and use result, num1 and num2 for the list. After that, I use a for loop to make the code run easily,
And the sum of result is the final result, return it at the end of the loop.



Important variables:
1. def plot_iranian_least_digits_histogram(histogram)
2. def plot_distribution_by_sample_size
3. def mean_squared_error(numbers1, numbers2):
4.     l = len(numbers1)
    ds = []
    for i in range(l):
        ds.append((numbers1[i] - numbers2[i]) ** 2)
    MSE = sum(ds) / l
    return MSE
5.def compare_iranian_mse_to_samples(iranian_mse, number_of_iranian_samples)


For this final program, I have one problem:
When I use the first function to use the US file, some people in some areas have no record for voting.
I don't know whether should I delete them or set up them as O, I choose to set up them us 0.
